Think of Milestones as a collection of experiences rather than an achievement list. Your Sim isn't required to complete them all.\n\nAchieving certain Milestones can affect your Sim's behavior and mood, reward special memorabilia, and unlock new interactions.--></T>

When a Sim completes a Milestone, it will appear under the appropriate category. Hovering over the Icon will tell you information about the Milestone.
