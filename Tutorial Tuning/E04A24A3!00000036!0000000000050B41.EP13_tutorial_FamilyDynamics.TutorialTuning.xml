      <T n="text">0x4484A464<!--Family Dynamics define the relationship between two family members, revealing how they'll feel and act when around each other. Different familial relationships allow for different types of dynamics to be set. Once two Sims have a dynamic, you'll notice them receiving unique buffs when spending time together, and autonomously choosing interactions that suit the nature of their dynamic.--></T>
