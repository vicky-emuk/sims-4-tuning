Upon purchasing the base, any Sim aged Teen or older can begin building the treehouse. Once building starts, any Sim from Child age and older can join in to help.\n\nAfter the treehouse is fully built, Sims with enough Handiness Skill can upgrade it with fun additions like a slide or bell. Child Sims can also redecorate the treehouse to match their interests.--></T>
