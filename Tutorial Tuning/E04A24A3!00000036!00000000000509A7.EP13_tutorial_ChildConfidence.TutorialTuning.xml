      <T n="text">0x65E61BD5<!--All Children Sims have a Confidence Level. Confidence begins in a Neutral state but may become High or Low throughout a Sim's childhood. Having High or Low Confidence will impact a Child's mood, and the effects may have a long-term affect on Self-Esteem throughout their lives.\n\nA child Sim's confidence level can increase or decrease depending on skill gain, school performance, positive and negative socialization, succeeding or failing in skill-based activities, confident or embarrassed moods, and more. Caregivers criticizing or praising a child's behavior also impacts their confidence levels.\n\nA Child's current Confidence Level is visible as a Temporary Trait in the Simology Panel.--></T>

They can be easily encouraged or discouraged when gaining or losing confidence. A Sim with Neutral Confidence will have neither High nor Low Self-Esteem when aging into a teen.--></T>

Support means everything to these Sims. If not addressed, Low Confidence becomes Low Self-Esteem when aging into a teen.--></T>
