      <T n="text">0x6777E855<!--Infant Milestones are celebrated moments where Infant Sims experience life and develop capabilities as they learn and grow. Some Infant Milestones come from natural development or socialization, while others can be progressed through Milestone-specific interactions. Like regular Milestones, Infant Milestones are about the journey of raising an Infant.\n\nInfants can achieve Firsts, Life, Social, Gross Motor, and Fine Motor Milestones.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x6F792A4D<!--As you progress through Infant Milestones, you will unlock new behaviors and interactions for Infants and Caregivers. For example, as Infants progress in their Gross Motor milestones they'll gain the Fun Need, which opens up new possibilities with various play objects to keep your Infant happy.\n\nIf you can achieve the more advanced Infant Milestones, your Infant can get a head start on their Toddler skills when they age up.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE2D3BA67<!--While all Sims can achieve Social Milestones, Infant Social Milestones help them develop emotionally and verbally. These Milestones will allow them to better express themselves and build relationships with other Sims. The more Social Milestones they unlock as an Infant, the more advanced their Toddler Communication skill becomes.\n\nHave other Sims run <font color="#199C2C"><b>Friendly</b></font> interactions with the Infant to get started! As they progress, Infants can start to verbally respond to other Sims, toys, stuffed animals, and even when trying new food.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xB634B83C<!--Achieving Fine Motor Milestones allow Infants to strengthen smaller muscles for more controlled and precise movements in their hands. These Milestones affect how they interact with toys and food in the High-Chair. The more Fine Motor Milestones they unlock as an Infant, the more advanced their Toddler Thinking skill becomes.\n\nUsing the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Way-to-Play Playmat</b></font> is a great way to start building up those tiny muscles. After learning the basics, playing with toybox toys, nesting blocks, and dollhouses will help further them along.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x2531CC03<!--Achieving Gross Motor Milestones allow Infants to develop the muscles in their body for whole body movement and coordination. The more Gross Motor Milestones they unlock as an Infant, the more advanced their Toddler Movement skill becomes.\n\nTo start, all Infants depend on other Sims for mobility, so progressing through these Milestones will affect how your Infant can get around by themselves. Once they learn to Sit Up, they can scoot around nearby. After learning how to crawl, your Infant will get a taste of independence and excitement for what the world has to offer!\n\nHave a caregiver practice <b>Tummy Time Together</b> found in the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Activities</b></font> category under <font color="#199C2C"><b>Friendly</b></font> interactions to start with the basics. As they achieve more Milestones, they will unlock more interactions targeted to practicing and strengthening their muscles!--></T>
