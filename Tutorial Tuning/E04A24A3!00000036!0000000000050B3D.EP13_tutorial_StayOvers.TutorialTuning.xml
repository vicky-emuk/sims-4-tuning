      <T n="text">0x205F3B4D<!--Stay Overs are a new type of event that involve family or friends sleeping over at your Sim's house for a set period of time. Since these can last multiple days, it's a good idea to make sure visiting Sims have a place to sleep!\n\nOnly one Stay Over can be active for a household at any time. Other events, such as birthday parties or weddings, can be held during a Stay Over! Planning a Stay Over is a great way to tell stories involving guests arriving a few days early for a big event.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE7127EC2<!--Stay Overs can be initiated from the Calendar, Phone, or Relationship Panel. It's a good idea to double check the guest list and duration prior to confirming your plans. There might also be times when another Sim outside of your Sim's household calls to arrange a Stay Over!\n\nDuring the Stay Over, guests can be asked to help around the house, or simply relax during their stay. The choice is yours!--></T>
