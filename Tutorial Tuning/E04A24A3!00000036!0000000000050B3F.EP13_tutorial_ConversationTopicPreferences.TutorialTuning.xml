      <T n="text">0x8A0F84A4<!--Conversation Topic preferences can be selected from the <b>Likes and Dislikes</b> section in CAS. Liking a Conversation Topic indicates that <b>your Sim enjoys having other Sims interact with them in that way</b>. Disliking a Conversation Topic means <b>your Sim will likely reject that type of interaction when another Sim performs it</b>. For example, if your Sim <b>Dislikes Gossip</b>, they will most likely respond negatively when another Sim tries to Gossip with them. But that won't stop them from being able to perform Gossip interactions towards another Sim.--></T>

Upon learning another Sim's Conversation Topic preferences, you can easily find the types of interactions they enjoy hearing (and avoid the ones they don't!)--></T>
