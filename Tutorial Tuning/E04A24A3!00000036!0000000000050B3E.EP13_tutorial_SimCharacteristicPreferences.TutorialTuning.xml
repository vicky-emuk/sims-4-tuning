      <T n="text">0xAE40F428<!--Sim Characteristic preferences can be selected from the <b>Likes and Dislikes</b> section in CAS. Each type corresponds to a category other Sims might fall into based on their traits, Likes and Dislikes for Activities, and other aspects of their personality they might have gained during their life.\n\nFor example, the Homebody category includes Sims with traits like <b>Loner</b> or <b>Bookworm</b>, but also Sims that <b>Like Writing</b> or <b>Like Cooking</b>. Liking and Disliking a wide range of different Sim Characteristics will lead to more variation in compatibility with other Sims!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x471A551A<!--When meeting other Sims, the Sim Characteristic Likes and Dislikes your Sim has selected will be compiled into a <b>Social Compatibility</b> that falls into one of five levels: Awful, Bad, Neutral, Good, or Amazing Compatibility. This compatibility score takes the Sim Characteristic Likes and Dislikes of both Sims into account!\n\nWhen your Sim has compatibilities that aren't Neutral, you can see them for each Sim in the <b>Relationships</b> panel in <b>Live Mode</b>. Sims with better compatibility will find it much easier to become friends, while worse compatibility will present a considerable challenge for developing that relationship.--></T>
