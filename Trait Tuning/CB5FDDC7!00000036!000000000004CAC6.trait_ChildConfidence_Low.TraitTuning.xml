Support means everything to these Sims. If not addressed, Low Confidence becomes Low Self-Esteem when aging into a teen.\n\nA child Sim's confidence level can increase or decrease depending on skill gain, school performance, positive and negative socialization, succeeding or failing or skill-based activities, confident or embarrassed moods, and more. Caregivers criticizing or praising a child's behavior also impacts their confidence levels.--></T>
